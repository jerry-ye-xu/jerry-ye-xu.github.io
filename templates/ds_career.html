	<h2 id="title">Thinking about a Career in Data Science?</h2>	

	<p> My recommended subjects if you want to be in Data Science. I would suggest doing a 4/5 year degree, as there are so many subjects that are useful in addition to this list. </p> 

	<p> I assume that you will be majoring in statistics (the new Data Science does not seem appealing to me). </p>

	<p> If you are heavily into the theoretical side and want to be involved in research, majoring in math and computer science may provide a stronger foundation. </p>

	<p> This is the list of subjects I would have compeleted in hindsight given a 3 year degree. As I mentioned before, I would suggest at least 4 year degree. </p>
