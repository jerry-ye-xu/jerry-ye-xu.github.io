Below are some notes I have written for my own self-study. To be best of my ability I have tried to approach them as if I was teaching future undergraduate students and providing them with an easy read during commutes.

<ul>
	<li>
 		<a href="/notes/statistical_inference.pdf">STAT3913: Statistical Inference (Advanced) [d-1.0.0]</a>
	</li>
<!-- 	<li>
 		<a href="/notes/linear_algebra.pdf">MATH2922: Linear and Abstract Algebra (Advanced), Selected Topics [dh-1.0.0]</a>
	</li>
	<li>
 		<a href="/notes/algorithms.pdf">COMP3927: Algorithm Design (Advanced) Selected Topics [dh-1.0.0]</a>
	</li> -->
</ul>

I would love to hear any feedback.
