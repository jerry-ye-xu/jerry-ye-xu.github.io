Below are some notes I have written for my own self-study. To be best of my ability I have tried to approach them as if I was teaching future undergraduate students and providing them with an easy read during commutes.

<ul>
	<li>
 		<a href="/notes/statistical_inference.pdf">STAT3913: Statistical Inference (Advanced)</a>
	</li>
</ul>

I would love any feedback of course.
