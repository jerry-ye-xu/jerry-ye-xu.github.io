A few months ago I wrapped up an internship at Data61, after spending 3 months there over the summer on a research project.

The experience was great and pretty much everything I could ask for in a summer internship.

I got to:

- Work with state-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning models in an area that I cared about; biomedical + NLP
- Combine the NLP with another field called information retrieval which is super fascinating in its own right
- Publish a paper (the equivalent of a project end-to-end)
- Learn how to use PyTorch

As icing on the cake, I got along really well with my supervisor so I never really had any issues with asking lots of questions or making micro-decisions on which direction my research could go.

In this post I want to discuss why a summer research stint could be good even if you are not interested in pursuing research as a career.

### Is it worth?

Since penultimate year summer internships often lead to graduate programs, then I think in most cases the decision is fairly straightforward.

However, suppose you are doing a 4/5 year degree and have one extra summer to work with then summer research could be an interesting option to explore.

Personally, the research experience has been invaluable in giving me a period of time to just sit down and try to understand things. I could spend a whole day reading papers on the latest models, or someoneâ€™s PhD thesis for building a novel ranking algorithm.

This is a huge plus, because in a normal job youâ€™re always under stakeholder deadlines and thereâ€™s pressure to deliver on many fronts. There are all many more aspects to productionising machine learning models than just building a good model - see [here]([https://research.google/pubs/pub46555/](https://research.google/pubs/pub46555/)) and so giving 100% attention to modelling is difficult.

If youâ€™re a student who wants to go into industry, this post makes the case for the types of research stints that might be worth devoting a summer for.

When choosing a research project, I would focus on the three things.

### 1) The nature of the project

The research project you do should be more application-focused e.g. for me I was competing in a task competition to build the best model.

An application-focused project means the skills are likely more transferable.

Theoretical projects are also great (for your own learning) but its relevance to industry might be weaker.

If you are into ML, preferably the project should be coding heavy so you can pick up a new framework like PyTorch or Tensorflow.

There is a caveat however. I noticed that some projects were coding heavy but it was more closer to building an MVP software product rather than doing research and applying SOTA models.

The opportunity to dive deep into SOTA by using the deep-learning frameworks was probably the most important aspect for me.

### 2) Your supervisor

Research can be pretty overwhelming if you have no prior background. The number of ML papers being published have increased dramatically over the last few years, and trying to wade through the sea of papers can be daunting.

In addition to getting along well with your supervisor, it would be much easier for you if they made macro-level decisions on what the research area is, which papers you would be replicating or extending and what the impact of the research is.

People prefer different management styles, but I really enjoyed being able to toss ideas around with my supervisor, so I would argue that having a supervisor who checks in on you regularly is important and who can afford to spend some time sporadically to discuss ideas.

In this case, itâ€™s a trade-off between prestige (the more important the person is the less time they have for you) and mentorship.

### 3) Chance of publication

Your research should be directly relevant to your supervisorâ€™s work and to the teamâ€™s work. When I started at Data61, one of the researchers who had a summer intern last year told me that I should aim to publish.

When I first heard this I was pretty intimidated since thats what PhDs "do" and I am only an undergrad, but in hindsight it wasnâ€™t too bad.

Many undergraduate students publish papers alongside their supervisors and it is definitely achievable if you are working on the right projects.

If you publish, then its definitely the strongest form of recognition for your work over summer.

### Conclusion

Summer internships are definitely worth considering if machine learning is one of your interests. I would highly recommend Data61 - the experience has been amazing.

I would like to take the chance to thank my supervisor and the whole team as well as my supervisorâ€™s supervisor - you guys were great.

Have fun!
