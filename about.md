  Hey there! Welcome to my website. I blog about statistics and computer science here, and write about other things on <a href="https://medium.com/@jerry_ye_xu">Medium</a>.

### Hello!

I'm currently working full-time at Commonwealth Bank and studying part-time at Sydney university. My nights are focused on studying computer science and math, and I also have an interest in Asia's tech space, especially China. 

I studied Japanese in school and speak fluent Mandarin.

### What I am up to

At Commonwealth Bank I work as a data scientist, building and deploying web applications and applying machine learning to solve data science problems. 

I am currently studying math and computer science at USyd whilst dabbing into Bayesian statistics through self-study.

During an off-day you will definitely find me doing bag work or rolling on the mats. =) 

I also happen to be a huge fan of podcasts, having hosted one in a prior life. My current favourites are The Tim Ferris Show, Disrupting Japan, and China Tech Talk.
