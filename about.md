  Hey there! Welcome to my website. I blog about statistics and computer science here, and write about other things on <a href="https://medium.com/@jerry_ye_xu">Medium</a>.

### Hello!

My name is Jerry, a math and computer science student at Sydney university.

I am currently doing research at Data61, applying deep learning models used in NLP to information retrieval problems in the biomedical space.

Welcome to my webpage, please feel free to look around.

I use this space for two reasons; 1) jotting down ideas to use as a reference and (hopefully!) motivate readers to dig deeper into the subject, and 2) to reflect upon my experiences and learnings.

Sometimes there are things I would like to remember, sometimes there are things I would like to share, sometimes it's both. Either one of those reasons is sufficient for me to write.

Writing reflections is a proactive way to mull over my thoughts and entertain readers to snippets of introspection.

### Brief History

Previously I held data science roles at Commonwealth Bank and a startup called Hivery doing a mixture of data engineering, proof-of-concepts and time series analysis.

In a previous life, I ran my own podcast and chess school.

One day I stumbled across venn diagram similar to the one below and decided that data science sounded cool.

My reasons for pursuing math and computer science have since matured, and I have been enjoying the journey more and more.

### Hobbies and Interests

During an off-day you will definitely find me doing bag work or rolling on the mats. =)

I keep an eye out for Asia's tech space, especially China. I studied Japanese in school and speak Mandarin.

I also happen to be a huge fan of podcasts, having hosted one in a prior life. My current favourites are The Tim Ferris Show, Disrupting Japan, and China Tech Talk.
