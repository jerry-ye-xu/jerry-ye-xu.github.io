### Hello!

My name is Jerry, currently doing research in information retrieval and NLP at Data61 and a math and computer science student at Sydney university.

Prior to this I worked at Commonwealth Bank and a startup called Hivery.

2 years ago after wrapping up podcasting I became interested in data science whilst working at Hivery, and have continued to develop in this area =).

During an off-day you will definitely find me doing bag work or rolling on the mats. =)

I keep an eye out for Asia's tech space, especially China. I studied Japanese in school and speak fluent Mandarin.

I also happen to be a huge fan of podcasts, having hosted one in a prior life. My current favourites are The Tim Ferris Show, Disrupting Japan, and China Tech Talk.
