### Hello!

My name is Jerry, a math and computer science student at Sydney university.

Welcome to my webpage, please feel free to look around.

I use this space for two reasons; 1) detailing knowledge to jog my memory and motivate readers to dig deeper into the subject, and 2) to reflect upon my experiences and learnings.

When I was growing up, my parents were busy working and I was left to my own device of sorts, and as a result was forced to be my own critic from a young age.

Writing reflections is a concrete way to ascertain my learnings for the future and if possible, entertain readers to pitfalls they may want to avoid.

### Brief History

Previously I held data science roles at Commonwealth Bank and a startup called Hivery, doing a mixture of data engineering, building proof-of-concepts and time series analysis.

In a previous life, I ran my own podcast and chess school before deciding that the venn diagram below was so cool that I decided to give it a shot.

And I have been enjoying every moment!

### Hobbies and Interests

During an off-day you will definitely find me doing bag work or rolling on the mats. =)

I keep an eye out for Asia's tech space, especially China. I studied Japanese in school and speak fluent Mandarin.

I also happen to be a huge fan of podcasts, having hosted one in a prior life. My current favourites are The Tim Ferris Show, Disrupting Japan, and China Tech Talk.
