title: Data Science for Students
---

Hi there!

Are you an undergraduate student thinking about doing data science? 

Heard about this really 'cool' career but not sure what it is all about?

Or maybe you just want to know what to study in university?

Well I might have some answers for you below. =)

### What is data science?

I have read many interpretations of what data science is. 

In academia one tends to see data science as a misused, overhyped term that sprouted from the desire of businesses to keep up with AI technology. In industry it is in high demand, and the job scope can vary from extremely technical to, well, not so technical. 

So let's clarify one thing before we move on. 

__Data science has not matured yet in industry__. At least in Australia it has not. There is still much ambiguity in what data science constitutes and how it should function in various industries. 

If I were to interpret data science in the context of the value it could potentially bring to a company, I would argue that it serves a combination of the 3 functions:

1. Streamline business operations and priorities 
1. Uncover hidden value from existing products/services
1. Be the analytical backbone of certain software applications 

So how is that relevant to a student like yourself that is looking for a job in data science? Well, I can say that studying the right subjects will certainly help you stand out. 

### Making the most of your university degree

The hardest part of your uni degree is that fact that you have to juggle many disciplines and schools of thought. You would be surprised though, to find out that just about everything you study in these 3 disciplines will be intertwined in some way. 

If this is your calling, you will find alot of enjoyment as you piece the puzzle together yourself. 

If you are heavily into the theoretical side and want to be involved in research, prioritising a major in pure math and may provide a stronger foundation.

Below is a table of subjects that I, given hindsight, would have taken during my undergraduate studies. This is the subject choice for Sydney University, and it is likely that you will find corresponding subjects at other universities.

| Year  |  Semester  |                     |          |          |          |
|:------|:----------:|:-------------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| 1st   | One        | MATH1921 + MATH1902 | INFO1110 | Elective | Elective |
|       | Two        | MATH1931 + MATH1905 | INFO1112 | INFO1113 | Elective |
| 2nd   | One        | MATH2922            | STAT2911 | COMP2823 | COMP2017 |
|       | Two        | MATH2923            | DATA2902 | COMP2922 | Elective |
| 3rd   | One        | MATH3961            | MATH2921 | STAT3922 | COMP3927 |
|       | Two        | MATH3969            | STAT3913 | STAT3888 | COMP3530 |
| 4th   | One        | MATH3971            | MATH3976 | DATA3404 | STAT3925 |
|       | Two        | MATH3968            | MATH3888 | COMP3520 | COMP3988 |

You can find the relevant handbooks [here]("https://sydney.edu.au/handbooks/science/").

Note: This is purely my own opinion. You do not have to do all of these subjects. Feel free to mix and match with your own interests. Also, some of the subject combinations can be extremely challenging. You may want to shuffle it around, especially 2nd year semester 1. 

Note 2: Of course, there are other math combinations that lean more towards pure math, like abstract algebra, complex analysis etc.

Note 3: The curriculum may have been updated since this post has been published. You should check the university handbooks for the relevant subjects. 

Note 4: This subject list does not cover some other areas, like decision and information theory, asymptotics and stohastic processes, econometrics or even engineering disciplines etc. etc. where much of this is applied in a specific context. 

### Final Thoughts

My journey into data science has been as eye-opening as it is intellectually rewarding. Whatever your goals are, I hope my advice here will help you get closer to them.

Good luck, and enjoy the roller coaster because it ain't stoppin' anytime soon.
